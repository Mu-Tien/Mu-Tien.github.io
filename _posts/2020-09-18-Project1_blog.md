title: My Project1- Data analysis about National Hocky League!
---

Here's the link of my hithub pages repo: [my repo](https://mu-tien.github.io/ST558_Project1/)\


In this project I made some functions for user to reach to the endpoints they want. Also, I did some data analysis using different endpoints.
The data analysis  can be separated into 2 section. First, I show some numeric summary and some plot for the 31 active team. Secondly, I didi some research on 4 selected team.
I choose NY islanders, Tampa Bay lightening, Vegas Golden Knights, Dallas stars, which are in the Conference Finals in 2019-20 NHL season.

In this project I understand that NHL has 2 conference, each has 2 division. And I also got the information about the difference between regular season and play off season. 
Moreover, I have better idea about the difference between goal and point. I understand there are skaters (with different position) and goalier. 
Finally, I think Hocky has a long history, so the dataset is so huge that I cannot use my eyes to review the data. 
If possible, maybe try to predict the next winner will be a interesting topic using these data.

**What would you do differently in approaching the project?**\
I spend so much times understatnding the NHL before I really started to work on my coed in this project because I have 0 knowledge about Hocky.
I think I would like to try to have a content first when I googling the information and then starting to writing the code. This can give me a more clear direction to the whole project.

**What was the most difficult part of the logic and programming for you?**\
I think the most difficult is when writing code to achieve the endpoints. There are so many possible issue can happen if my caed are really going to publish to people. 
Therefore, I have to write so many `if` statement during the code. And sometimes whether or not to use else is really important when you have so many if statement there.


**What are you big take-aways for the future projects?**\
For the next project, I think I should have better GPP during the process not just when the project is finish. 
Since this project takes about 2 weeks to work, sometimes when I came back to work, I forgot what kind of data set I had already made. Therefore, I have so much dataset stored in my document.
Which is really inefficient. If a can have a discription in the comment to tell myself what I have done today. That will reduce a lot of times for my work next time.
