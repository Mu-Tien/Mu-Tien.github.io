title: Data analysis about National Hocky League!
---

Here's the link of my hithub pages repo: [my repo](https://mu-tien.github.io/ST558_Project1/)


In this project I made some functions for user to reach to the endpoints they want. Also, I did some data analysis using different endpoints.
The data analysis can be separated into 2 sections. First, I show some numeric summaries and some plots for the 31 active team. Secondly, I did some research on 4 selected teams.
I choose NY islanders, Tampa Bay lightening, Vegas Golden Knights, Dallas stars, which are in the Conference Finals in 2019-20 NHL season.

In this project I understand that NHL has 2 conference, each has 2 division. And I also got the information about the difference between regular season and play off season. 
Moreover, I have better idea about the difference between goal and point. I understand there are skaters (with different position) and goalier. 
Finally, I think Hocky has a long history, so the datasets are huge that I cannot use my eyes to review the data. 
If possible, maybe try to predict the next winner will be a interesting topic using these data.
