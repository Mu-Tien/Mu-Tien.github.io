title: Response to my first after learning more about R
---

1. **What (if anything) has changed about what you think a data scientist is and what they do**\
   After this semester learning more about the data science and coding in R. I think the most difference between data analyst and data scientist is that
   data scientist trying to build up the model which can help us predict or try to know somthing we wanna know, on the other hand, data analyst only trying to 
   tell you the story behind the data. Therefore, I would say that data analyst is more realistic than data scientist when data science is more challenging than data analysis.
   
2. **What your current thoughts are in terms of using R for data science - do you think you'll continue to use R going forward?  Why or why not?**\
  After this semester, I really think I can say I have an Intermediate level on writing R code.\
  All the package we used this semester are super easy to learn.
  I really like to work with R. However, in real life, when you trying to find a job as a data scientist, Python seems more popular on the job discrption.
  So, I think maybe I will use them both in the future.
  Yet, I'm still a huge fan of R.
  
3. **What things are you going to do differently in practice now that you've had this course?**\
    After this course, I'll do everything in R if I can. For example, when I haven't taken this class. I always having trouble with read in dataset. After this class, I know that
    dplyr are super convenient to use when cleaning data. Also, after knowing ggplot2, there's no more black and white original R plot in my report. The world with colorful plots
    makes me so proud of myself.
