**1. What are your thoughts on R vs whatever other software you've used?** \
     Actually I only use a few software. When I was an undergraduate, I learned `C++` as my first language. Maybe because it was my very first time coding. I think it is vary hard for me to use. 
     However, it built up a steady logic fundation of coding inside my brain.\
     After that, I learned python and R. In my opinion, These two language are pretty similary. They are both dealing with data, Great at graphing. Showing plot is a great skill fpr data scientists
     However, I think R is more easier than python.\
     After graduate, I did an intern job for a few month. During this time, I used excel VBA a lot. I think, it just a tool in Excel, it cannot be counted as a computer langue. So just forget this.\
     When I first came to NC state, I learned SAS. I think SAS is pretty fun to use. Many options, many skill. However, the language is so different to the others. So, R is still my No.1 Language.
     Finally I would say that, most code have the same logic, cuz I used lots of if statement, read in data, draw a plot, etc. We would have to google the syntax of a language when we left it for a long time.
     Buy, we will not forget how to `if` something or `plot` something.
     
**2. What functionality do you like about R?  What parts do you miss about your other language?**
     I really like R because there's a lot of package in R, we can install them and understand it through `help`. And then that is something we can simply use.
     I also like R markdown. This is sooooo convenient when doing homework and project.
     However, I when plotting sometimes I missed python a little bit.
     
**3. Do you consider R a difficult language to learn? (If you knew R prior to the course, describe your experience when first learning it.)**
     Not at all, I think R is very easy to learn among all the language I've used. When I first using R, I just used it as a calculator. I use `C(...)` to claculate so many probability in the same formula.
     Till, now I can run a machain learning, Rjags and so many skills in R. I like it so much!
